    <string name="flexiHelpMessage">FlexiTasks are tasks without a fixed date. They still have a rough time frame they need to be completed in, but this time frame is flexible. They are ranked and given a priority color based on how due/overdue they are relative to their time frame. For instance a weekly task that is 1 day overdue is considered more overdue than a yearly task that is 1 week overdue.
